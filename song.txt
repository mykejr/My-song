for sone reason of this twisted fate
I have met you when I needed grace
Stared in your eyes and it warmed my heart
From that moment on I knew
I could carry on

Beautiful eyes come with me
Beautiful eyes dream with me
Bring me the light
You freed me

These eyes are the fire 
In freezing cold
They give water to my drying soul
They sing to me in deaf silence
Pure kindness the shining star
In pitch black

Beautiful eyes 
Come with me
Bring me the light 
Dream with me
Stars in the sky
Shine for me
Beautiful eyes holding me

I feel it deep inside of me
These eyes keep holding me
Nothing else  is left for me
Now I am free
